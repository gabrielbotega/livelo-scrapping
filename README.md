# livelo-scrapping
project to scrap livelo real-to-point promo

This project has only learning purpose. Where I can learn to scrap info from a website which I'm used to buy from. therefore, I've created a script in which I can track some promos and making some points to travel.

I'm using Python and Selenium to scrape.

Further development must be made to make it prettier and use as a functional tool (correlate these infos with travel oportunities or dicounts in some products). :)
